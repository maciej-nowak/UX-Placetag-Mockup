# UX-Placetag-Mockup
Mockup of Placetag mobile app. Created at the University as the project within User Experience classes in 2015 (with cooperation with Allegro). The purpose of this project was to design mobile app with UX rules and to get know what processes are involved in UX.  

# The beginning 
Thanks to those classes the idea of creating Placetag app was born. It helped us to understand user's need and his expectation. Creating Placetag app was contiuned during other classes at the university. Placetag has been our (my team) engineering project. 

# Placetag
Now Placetag is available at http://placetag.pl and in Play Store.
